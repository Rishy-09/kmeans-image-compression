# 🎨 K-Means Image Compression

This notebook shows how **K-Means Clustering** can compress an image by reducing its color palette, keeping visual quality intact while minimizing file size.

### 🔍 What it does:
- Applies unsupervised clustering (K-Means) to pixel RGB values
- Compresses an image by reducing thousands of colors to just 16
- Visual comparison of **original vs compressed** image

### 📊 Results

### 🚀 Run it
- Clone this repo or open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- Try adjusting the number of clusters `K` to see quality vs. compression
